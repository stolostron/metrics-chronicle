# Server Foundation Metrics

Nomenclature:

- `Not exposed` implies not in ACM Observability [default allow-list](https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-observability-operator/blob/main/operators/multiclusterobservability/manifests/base/config/metrics_allowlist.yaml)
- `New` implies just added as a part of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management version 2.8 or multicluster engine version 2.3.
- `From Managed Cluster` implies these are not emitted from the hub server, but from the managed cluster.
